# 1. run harmonization from file (xlsx, csv, parquet)
# 2. decide output format
# 3. allow to filter on Patients with predicates
# 4. setup logging (passed from main or cli)
# don't implement valdiation, specific filters, etc --> all that can be downstream

# need to add methods to HarmonizedData:
#   to dict
#   to dataframe (csv, xlsx)
